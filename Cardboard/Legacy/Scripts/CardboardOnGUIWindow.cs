using UnityEngine;

// Works with CardboardOnGUI to show all or part of the OnGUI-rendered
// UI on a mesh in the scene.  There should be one or more of these
// as children of the CardboardOnGUI gameobject.  Each one specifies
// the region of the captured OnGUI screen to show on its own mesh.
// This allows you to place pieces of the GUI in the scene at different
// distances and angles to the user without having to change any of the
// OnGUI methods themselves.
//
// The rendering code here takes care of shader and texture setup.  The
// choice of mesh is yours, but a quad looks good.  The mesh is scaled to
// match the aspect ratio of the screen region shown.  The attached
// collider is used for ray instersection with the user's gaze, so it
// should return texture coordinates that match those of the meshfilter.
//
// Individual portions of the GUI can be turned on or off by enabling
// this component independently of the sibling gameobjects.
