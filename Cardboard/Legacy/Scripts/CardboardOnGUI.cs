/// A utility class for redirecting OnGUI()-based UI elements onto a texture,
/// which can be drawn on a surface in the scene and thus appear in stereo.
/// The auxiliary CardboardOnGUIWindow class handles displaying the texture
/// in the scene.  CardboardOnGUI captures the OnGUI() calls, which need to be
/// modified slightly for this to work, and handles feeding back fake mouse
/// events into the Unity player based on the user's head and trigger actions.
///
/// If the option is available, it is probably better to use a real 3D
/// GUI such as the new Unity4.6+ system.  But if you just want to get
/// existing projects based on OnGUI() to work in Cardboard, this class
/// can help.
///
/// Position the GUI mesh in 3D space using the gameobject's transform.  Note: do
/// not place the object as a child of the CardboardHead, or the user will not be
/// able to look at different parts of the UI because it will move with them.  It is
/// better to place it as a sibling of the Head object.
