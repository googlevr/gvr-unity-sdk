// A utility class for redirecting OnGUI()-based UI elements onto a texture,
// which can be drawn on a surface in the scene and thus appear in stereo.
// The auxiliary CardboardOnGUIWindow class handles displaying the texture
// in the scene.  CardboardOnGUI captures the OnGUI() calls, which need to be
// modified slightly for this to work, and handles feeding back fake mouse
// events into the Unity player based on the user's head and trigger actions.
//
// If the option is available, it is probably better to use a real 3D
// GUI such as the new Unity4.6+ system.  But if you just want to get
// existing projects based on OnGUI() to work in Cardboard, this class
// can help.

  // the center for the user to be able to interact with them.  As this would
