///
/// This script must be added to any camera that should render stereo when the app
/// is in VR Mode.  This includes picture-in-picture windows, whether their contents
/// are in stereo or not: the window itself must be twinned for stereo, regardless.
///
/// For each frame, StereoController decides whether to render via the camera it
/// is attached to (the _mono_ camera) or the stereo eyes that it controls (see
/// CardboardEye). You control this  decision for all cameras at once by setting
/// the value of Cardboard#VRModeEnabled.
///
/// For technical reasons, the mono camera remains enabled for the initial portion of
/// the frame.  It is disabled only when rendering begins in `OnPreCull()`, and is
/// reenabled again at the end of the frame.  This allows 3rd party scripts that use
/// `Camera.main`, for example, to refer the the mono camera even when VR Mode is
/// enabled.
///
/// At startup the script ensures it has a full stereo rig, which consists of two
/// child cameras with CardboardEye scripts attached, and a CardboardHead script
/// somewhere in the hierarchy of parents and children for head tracking.  The rig
/// is created if necessary, the CardboardHead being attached to the controller
/// itself.  The child camera settings are then cloned or updated from the mono
/// camera.
///
/// It is permissible for a StereoController to contain another StereoController
/// as a child.  In this case, a CardboardEye is controlled by its closest
/// StereoController parent.
///
/// The Inspector panel for this script includes a button _Update Stereo Cameras_.
/// This performs the same action as described above for startup, but in the Editor.
/// Use this to generate the rig if you intend to customize it.  This action is also
/// available via _Component -> Cardboard -> Update Stereo Cameras_ in the Editor’s
/// main menu, and in the context menu for the `Camera` component.
